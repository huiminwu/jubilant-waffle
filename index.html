      <p> You sneakily bring the box under your jacket and go to a bathroom. Phew, there's no one here. You proceed to go into a stall and open the box. All of sudden, purple particles jump out and form what looks like a portal. Do you step in? </p>

        <h5> <i> Ah yes! I've been waiting for you! Greetings young one, I am your second cousin, twice removed. Even though we're quite distant relatives you are my chosen successor. This might sound insane, but I am the king of the Magic Realm and need to pass down my throne to someone as brave and smart as you. If you agree to this, you'll have to go through lots of tests to prove to my council you are worthy. In the end, if you get their approval, you'll give up your mortal life and commit to life in the Magic Realm. If you do not agree to this or get disapproved, I have no choice but to send you back to the mortal realm. So, what's your choice? </i></h5>

        <p> As the door closes behind you, you feel a strong gust of wind. The sky turns a dark blue and there's just enough light from the moon to see a shadow a head of you getting larger and larger. You stand there in shock. Before you know it, the shadow turns out to be a very fast zombie, coming to eat you alive. What do you do? </p>

        <p> You yank a quill off your wings and aim it at the zombie. It misses. You try again and it hits the zombie in the eye. Just as the zombie begins to moan, his head falls off from the power force of the quill. It's body crawls towards you, but before you know it, its arms and legs fall off as well. The zombie's death triggers a new wave of zombies, seems like 10 or so. They're slowly walking towards you. What do you do?</p>
