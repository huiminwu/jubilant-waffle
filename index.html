        <p> You're walking out of your SciFi class and see a shiny box that's giving you weird vibes. Do you investigate? </p>

      <p> You sneakily bring the box under your jacket and go to a bathroom. Phew, there's no one here. You proceed to go into a stall and open the box. All of sudden, purple particles jump out and form what looks like a portal. Do you step in? </p>

        <h5> <i> Ah yes! I've been waiting for you! Greetings young one, I am your second cousin, twice removed. Even though we're quite distant relatives you are my chosen successor. This might sound insane, but I am the king of the Magic Realm and need to pass down my throne to someone as brave and smart as you. If you agree to this, you'll have to go through lots of tests to prove to my council you are worthy. In the end, if you get their approval, you'll give up your mortal life and commit to life in the Magic Realm. If you do not agree to this or get disapproved, I have no choice but to send you back to the mortal realm. So, what's your choice? </i></h5>
